    <result xml:space="preserve">Your ship falls through thick layers of dark clouds. Red flashes illuminate your surroundings. The lights on your console warn you of the dangerously fast approaching energy level zero. As you finally break through the last cloud, you get a glimpse of what awaits you underneath. &#x000A;Black planes and sharp cliffs of a dark red shape the landscape. In the east you perceive a massive rock formation, in the west you see a thick blue stream cutting through the plane , illuminating big portions of it in the process. Somewhere to the south there seem to be some sort of industrial constructions, far in the north you believe to recognize cubic shapes that reveal a city. You don't have time to study the landscape much longer. All you concentration is desperately needed as you find a gap in the ghastly cliffs and bring down your ship. Heavy jolting, followed by a sudden blow signalize your landing. &#x000A;Your ship's on the ground, and you are too, barely. Welcome to Frizza.&#x000A;&#x000A;Frizza&#x000A;An Interactive Fiction by Tim&#x000A;Release 1 / Serial number 170711 / Inform 7 build 6M62 (I6/v6.33 lib 6/12N) SD&#x000A;&#x000A;Landing Zone&#x000A;You step out of your ship onto a small square in the middle of nowhere. Your ship's dead and so is the computer. It seems like you ought to explore the environment. You remeber having seen civilization-like shapes to the south-west and to the north. To the east  there is a huge mountain, to the west there seems to be a Flux.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see a Discharged Spaceship (in which is a Power Unit (empty)) here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

I'll introduce you to someone, and that is not an invitation.&#x000A;&#x000A; With seemingly little effort she climbs down the cliffs to your level, before insistently inviting you to come with her.&#x000A; Both of you walk through the scraggy landscape, her leading the way with distinct commands. Slowly you approach an archlike structure, close to one branch of the Flux. As you get nearer you perceive a couple of bulky shapes, guarding the entrance to the structure. Some hundred metes in front of the entrance your companion turns to you. &#x000A;&#x000A;Try not to look too provoking.&#x000A;&#x000A;You know why while passing the guards: each and every one of them gazes at you. In consideration of the thick armour plates, the rather oversized guns and their radiating blue glow you refrain from making any quick motions.&#x000A;&#x000A;Flux Gate&#x000A;A gate of some sort, guarded.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can go east.&#x000A;&#x000A;Inside you find yourself in the midst of a small-sized hall, that doesn't appear to justify any of the expenditure you just encountered. In the back you spot an opening and a staircase, leading downwards. To the left there is a full board of controls and two figures unhastily operating them. You can't look around any more, as you are approached quickly by an impressive sized person, already bellowing a few direct words with a booming voice.&#x000A;&#x000A;Dunia! Who is this? Explain yourself!&#x000A;&#x000A;A guest of sorts. He stumbled about the Ascent when I found him. I don't think he's a Techie, at least he has a slightly better manners and he keeps his voice down to a sensible level when talking. Besides, I thought about his use in regard to certain issues, due to his undujulike appearance.&#x000A;&#x000A;Both eyeball you thoroughly for what seems to you like hours. Eventually, the massive Duju makes a quick motion towards Dunia, indicating her to follow him. He shoots a last glance at you.&#x000A;&#x000A;Don't let yourself be found sniffing around somewhere, it would not contribute to your wellbeing.&#x000A;&#x000A; They march off, disappearing into the opening at the end of the hall. You are not guarded, it seems like you could look around. Of course you could also do as you were told and wait.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

It is used to extract small portions of the Flux and isolate it for examination. If you want to help us out, showing us that you have no evil intent in the process, go and extract two samples of the Flux, one from the current before it passes through this gate, and one after it has done so. I am sure you will find the proper locations for this purpose yourself.

However ... what might help you ... wait a moment.&#x000A;&#x000A; Dunia turns to the rack, which the gun lies on, and resolutely approaches it. With a few precise movements she breaks loose one of the bars framing the rack, accompanied by a bright clang. Even the guards take a short glance, before respectfully turning to the entrance again. Triumphantly, Dunia returns to you and hands you the bar with a smirk. &#x000A;&#x000A;Congratulations, you are now the owner of a convenient lifting tool.&#x000A;&#x000A;You receive a Miserable Lever.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

Shorty, you have visions of a brute Duju, clad in plates of thick metal, thorns protruding from the shoulders. Then a lean figure, wrapped in a long black robe, operating some sort of complex device in front of what seems to you like an altar. A penetrating beeping draws you out of your sight. The Extractor is finished. You scramble up to the shore and quickly bring some distance between you and the Flux, your mind and body slowly regaining their place. &#x000A;&#x000A;You receive an Unregulated Flux Essence.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>
