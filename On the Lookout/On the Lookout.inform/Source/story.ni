Instead of taking the gun for the first time, say "Until now you were considered peaceful. Taking a foreign gun in the middle of a foreign building could change that impression. Think good before taking it."

As you awake you find yourself in a small chamber with a sterile atmosphere. Three walls are of blank metal with blue veins in them, the fourth is vitreous and reveals a spectacular view: a vast plaza with mingling crowds of glowing shapes, surrounded by exotic buildings made out of crystal and white metal, transportation vehicles of no known origin and static guards, as heavily armed as the ones you saw before - and all radiating a constant bluish sheen like in a dream. However, as much as you see, as little you hear. The chamber seems to be soundproof. The impressions are overwhelming, you feel the exhaustion coming back and fall asleep where you lie.";

[Console]
The console is unexamined.

Before examining the console for the first time:
	now the description of the console is "A huge oval table, full of ... nothing, actually. All you see is a reflective surface, into which the operators dunk their hands, emitting small waves. Where they touch the surface, you believe to see tiny, interlinked pulses of blue light, like a neural system, but you can't be sure. [paragraph break]As you study the console, the two operators become aware of you, freezing in their motion and watching you suspiciously.[paragraph break]Anyhow, you could [bold type]examine[roman type] the console further."

Before examining the console for the second time:

You start to see a pattern in the waves and currents of the reflective surface ... it reminds you of the great Flux currents ... [paragraph break]As you continue to glance at the console, one of the operators pulls his hands out of it and stands up from his chair. Obviously you don't make a good impression by standing there, maybe it would be wise to say something or disengage from the console. Still, you could [bold type]examine[roman type] it further."

Before examining the console for the third time:

Instantly there are guards surrounding you, one of which quickly forces you to your knees and irresistibly renders you immobile with some sort of cuffs.

[Asking Operators]

After asking Duju Operator 1 about anything for the first time:

"Techies"	"[if Dunia is in the Upper Gate_Frizza][italic type]They were settler's, originally. Sadly they chose to defile the Flux with their robots and devices, hence their nickname.

"Kollock"	"[if Dunia is in the Upper Gate_Frizza][italic type]Our spiritual leader. Celebrated as god-king. 'He is master, he is Flux'.[paragraph break][roman type]Her tone seems to you tinged with a trace of sarcasm.

"Du'un"	"[if Dunia is in the Upper Gate_Frizza][italic type]My father and the Keeper of the Flux, if you didn't notice.

"Duju"	"[if Dunia is in the Upper Gate_Frizza][italic type]Our people. We have lived on this surface as long as we remember, and that indeed is a long time.

"Kollock"	"[italic type]Let him be blessed. Father of Duju. Father of Flux.[paragraph break][roman type]You hear nothing of serious approval in his voice, it sounds mechanical. His eyes are ice cold while saying the words.[paragraph break]"
"Dunia"	"[italic type]An ambitious child of a disrupted time. I would not call that bad, though. The most powerful beings emerge in times of conflict.[paragraph break]"
"Duju"	"[italic type]My people, and the most important thing on this planet - speaking as the Keeper. The Flux is us, you know that, thus I guard the Flux like I guard my very own flesh and blood.[paragraph break]"
"Orb"	"[italic type]Can you imagine the power of a sun? It is fathomless, it is the purest energy. This Orb above - it is like that. And like every sun enlivens the planets around it, so does the Orb on a smaller scale. Frizza - as it is commonly called - is an organism, and the Orbs are its hearts.[paragraph break]"

Finally, with a last compression, it looses the tension and returns to a still state, leaving no sign of the Unregulated Essence. Dunia briefly gives off a comment.[paragraph break][italic type]Now, that was spectacular.";

[End]

The Discharged Spaceship is inside the Landing Zone_Frizza. The description of the Discharged Spaceship is "Your spaceship, broken down due to power loss. The clouds in the atmosphere may have sped up the discharge."  The Discharged Spaceship is fixed in place.

Chapter 5 - Kaldríss

Section 1 - Crash Site

[Finding a way off the space ship]

[Axesto is a person. The Player is Axesto.]

[Spacesuit with energy capacitor]
A spacesuit is a kind of thing. A spacesuit is always wearable. An energy capacitor is a kind of container. The energy capacitor is part of every spacesuit.
The carrying capacity of an energy capacitor is always 1.
The description of the spacesuit is "Spacesuit Mk. XV[paragraph break]Made for deep space travel due to its extraordinary thermodynamic capabilities.[paragraph break]This model also has an energy capacitor built in that needs some kind of energy in order to properly work. The more pure the energy the more effective the suits thermal protection will work.".

After examining the spacesuit for the first time:
	say "After taking a closer look it seems like the suit doesn't have any juice left so you would still freeze pretty quickly after leaving the spaceship. Unless, of course, you find some kind of energy source that fits right in.".

[Warnings for inserting wrong items]
Before inserting protector glove into the energy capacitor:
	say "This glove will surely not fit into the capacitor so it's not advised to continue this action. Otherwise the energy capacitor might break";
	stop the action.	
	
Before inserting emergency torch into the  energy capacitor:
	say "No.";
	stop the action.
	
Before inserting encryption key into the energy capacitor:
	say "No.";
	stop the action.

Before inserting Yarwol's Keystone into the energy capacitor:
	say "No.";
	stop the action.

Before inserting the pure flux essence into the energy capacitor for the first time:
	say "[italic type]Do I really wanna do this? Chances of me dying are quite high. On the other hand, I will probably die anyway. Careful now. And ..[paragraph break]oh no ..[paragraph break]nonononono[paragraph break]WAIT .. IT WORKED! EUREKA![roman type]";
	continue the action.

[Protector Glove/Electricity]
A protector glove is a thing and wearable. The description of the protector glove is "This protector glove is made out of a special  rubber compound that temporarily absorbs any kind of energy thus protecting its wearer."

A thing can be safe or electrified. A thing is usually safe.

This is the electrocution-wisdom rule:
	if the player wears the protector glove, make no decision;
	if the action requires a touchable noun and the noun is electrified, say "You really shouldn't be touching [the noun] without something that protects you from its enormous amounts of energy. This flux essence consists of pure energy and would therefore immediately disintegrate your hand if you touched it without a [bold type]glove[roman type]." instead;

The electrocution-wisdom rule is listed before the basic accessibility rule in the action-processing rules.

After putting on the protector glove for the first time:
	say "This should work!";
	continue the action.

After taking the pure flux essence for the first time:
	say "This glove truly works wonders. No harm done.".

[Rooms]
[Yundar's Cave]
Yundar's Cave is a room. "This is one of many caves which the Yetíss have built under the surface of Kaldríss. This one seems to belong to a young female Yetíss called Yundar.  It also connects to another cave if you go further in the east." The printed name of Yundar's Cave is "Cave".

After going to Yundar's Cave for the first  time:
	say "Upon trying to make your way into the small cave entrance you slipped and went all the way down. Apart from a few scratches here and there you seem to be okay even though your head hurts quite a lot. You can barely see from where you landed but you see light a little further ahead and decide to go there. It's getting easier to see with every step you take and suddenly you hear noises. It sounds like someone is .. talking? You can't really understand what they are saying since it seems to be some ancient language but you heard the words [italic type]Yundar[roman type] and [italic type]Yarwol[roman type] being thrown around a couple of times so maybe those are names? Perhaps it's even humans who live down here. Maybe it's one of the explorers from the camp above you. This would certainly explain where they went. notice outlines of a figure that seems to resemble a human since. The last thing you heard were footsteps heading east."

[Yarwol's Cave]
Yarwol's Cave is a room. "This cave is where Yarwol, the oldest Yetíss, resides. You wonder how many more of these caves exist. What if there are so many caves that you will get lost and never see daylight again? What if one of those creatures finds you and eats you for breakfast? You better drop that negativity and start figuring out how to escape this place." The printed name of Yarwol's Cave is "Cave".

After going to Yarwol's Cave for the first time:
	say "You sneakily followed one of the mysterious creatures. Luckily nobody has noticed you. So far so good. Now it's time to find out how you could get out of here.  You take a look around this cave and notice these suspicious rocks. You can't help but feel like someone is trying to hide something behind them so probably you should try to very carefully shove them aside and see if your suspicions turn out to be true."


[Main Cave]
The Main Cave_Kaldríss is a room. "This is like the central cave that also acts as kind of a hub for all the Yetíss that live inside this cave system. Judging from the sheer size of it there must be hundreds of different caves down here." The printed name of the Main Cave_Kaldríss is "Cave".

After going to the Main Cave_Kaldríss for the first time:
	say "Looks like this is the cave that connects them all which also explains why it's that much bigger than the ones before.  You can also notice a tiny gap in the east wall. Directly next to it is a small hole in the wall that seems to have a very specific shape. It could be some kind of keyhole. If this assumption is true and this turns out to be a door of some kind then this might also be the way out of this cave system.".

[Secret Cave]
Secret Cave_Kaldríss is a room. "A secret cave that even most of the Yetíss don't know about. Only the ones worthy enough are allowed to enter." The printed name of the Secret Cave_Kaldríss is "Cave". 

Before going to Secret Cave_Kaldríss for the first time:
	say "You fumble around with the keystone until it suddenly fits exactly into the hole next to the small gap in the wall. A mechanism activates and the gap begins to widen. As soon as it's wide enough so you can fit through yo go for it hoping that nobody will follow you. Getting past the Yetíss undetected wasn't easy but in the end you managed to do it and now it's finally time to find a way off this planet! I can see a light above me that seems to be leading to .. some place? I should probably follow it before I get lost in the void. [italic type][bold type]Beam me up![roman type]";
	continue the action.

[NPCs]
Yundar is a woman in Yundar's Cave. The description of Yundar is "This specimen seems to be one of the younger Yetíss.  Looks chummy but at the same time terrifying to some extent."
Yarwol is a man in Yarwol's Cave.  The description of Yarwol is "Seems like this is the leader or at least one of the more important Yetíss. This creature definitely has seen better days since it looks very old, ancient even. It's totally possible that it has been here for the past century if not longer."

[Beam me up, Scotty!]
